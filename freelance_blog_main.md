# Alex Butler ‚ö°


Hello! My name is Alex Butler üëã. I am a freelance data/analytics engineer specializing in the _Modern Data Stack_ including proficiency with Python, Data Pipelines, SQL, Data Warehouse Design, Data Governance, and dbt (data build tool). I am a tech enthusiast interested in the cutting edge of modern analytics. {:rocket:}

Looking to Modernize your data stack? Managing expenses and churn in Excel? Struggling to democratize and share data amongst a growing team as a single source of truth? Difficulty creating KPIs to measure the performance of your business and make informed decisions? Or maybe just looking to hit the ground running early so you have no regrets later (inactionable data, compromised data, or data loss) due to lack of Data Governance.

I specialize in open source technologies. üôå
Together, we can solve your problems with either consulting sessions whereby I can speak with you and your team of analysts or engineers on what exactly constitutes the Modern Data Stack, why it exists, what dbt is, how to effectively deploy dbt on top of a data warehouse, and general design principles in an interactive session, or alternatively, I can be constracted directly to work with you and your team in standing up the infrastructure.

A common stack that can be deployed with minimum **monetary** overhead might look something like:

**EXTRACT LOAD**
- AWS EC instance with Airflow for job orchestration and Data Loaders authored in Python; good in the short term if sources are unlikely to change and/or the business has a Python Dev who can maintain with minimal time investment

**DATA WAREHOUSE**
- Google BigQuery

**TRANSFORM**
- dbt (Data Build Tool) Cloud (easiest) or deployment via AWS EC + Airflow for orchestration depending on analyst/engineer skillsets

**BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE**
- Metabase or Apache Superset with a lean towards Metabase (I contribute heavily to an open source project which supercharges dbt + Metabase üöÄ)

A common stack that can be deployed with minimum **technical** overhead might look something like:

**EXTRACT LOAD**
- Fivetran which will average 100$ per month for companies with less than a certain number of active rows (which is fine when compared to the expensive data engineer time it would take otherwise). Fivetran includes dbt packages for many sources which saves additional time/resources for your team.

**DATA WAREHOUSE**
- Google BigQuery / Snowflake depending on volume of data

**TRANSFORM**
- dbt (Data Build Tool) Cloud or deployment via AWS EC + Airflow for orchestration depending on analyst/engineer skillsets

**BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE**
- Metabase, Apache Superset, or Looker with a lean towards Metabase/Looker (Other options can be discussed as BI is an exciting field today)
